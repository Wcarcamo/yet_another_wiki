# Arch

I run Arch as my daily driver on my laptop.
This section will contain general notes about my experience.

## Package Management

Full Upgrade:

```{.sh}
$ pacman -Syu
```

Install a package:

```{.sh}
pacman -S {package}
```

Remove package:

```{.sh}
$ pacman -R {package}
```

Remove package and dependencies:

```{.sh}
$ pacman -Rns {package}
```

List AUR packages:

```{.sh}
$ pacman -Qm
```

## Root Directory Out of Space

One day my root directory was suddenly full. 
I have 20GB allocated for my root partition.

This prevented me from being able to update my system.

First, I ran the following to clear up some of my pacman package cache.

```{.sh}
$ paccache -r
```

This only removed 1.62 GiB worth of data.

I then ran the following to remove an additional 4 GiB:

```{.sh}
$ sudo pacman -Sc
```

I also use docker to test out different applications.
Images often take up a lot of space so I also used [docker system prune](./homelab/docker.qmd#system-prune) to make more space. 
This gave me another 1.5 GB back.

## Add System Users

These commands are run when you only have a `root` user account on any linux system. 
This might happen on fresh installations of various operating systems.

It's a good idea to create a separate account that does not have root privileges by default.
Instead, add the user to the `sudo` group to allow it to run higher privilege commands when they are needed.

```{.sh filename="Shell"}
# Add User
adduser username

# Add User to sudo group
usermod -a -G sudo username
```

:::{.callout-note}
`adduser` is a wrapper for `useradd`.
