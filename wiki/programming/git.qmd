# Github

## Troubleshoot SSH

One of my machines does not keep my ssh authentication running.
Below are some commands I use to check that the `ssh-agent` is running and using the right key to authenticate with my github repositories. 

```{.sh filename="Shell"}
# Check if ssh key appears 
ssh-add -l -E sha256

# Start the ssh-agent in the background, if not already running
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Reload ssh key, include file if using different naming convention than `id_rsa`
ssh-add ~/.ssh/my_key
```
