Welcome to **Yet Another Wiki** and [Yet Another Blog](./blog.qmd).

Names inspired by the [historical](https://yaml.org/spec/history/2001-08-01.html) YAML acronym, "Yet Another Markup Language".
As I write this, I've learned YAML now stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language".

However, I'm keeping the names as is.

The wiki is for technical documentation of my work.

The blog is for informal writings about tech I'm interested in.
