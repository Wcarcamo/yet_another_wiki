## Root Directory Out of Space

One day my root directory was suddenly full. 
I have 20GB allocated for my root partition.

This prevented me from being able to update my system.

First, I ran the following to clear up some of my pacman package cache.

```{.sh}
$ paccache -r
```

This only removed 1.62 GiB worth of data.

I then ran the following to remove an additional 4 GiB:

```{.sh}
$ sudo pacman -Sc
```

I also use docker to test out different applications.
Images often take up a lot of space so I also used [docker system prune](./homelab/docker.qmd#system-prune) to make more space. 
This gave me another 1.5 GB back.
