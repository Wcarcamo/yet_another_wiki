# Pi-Hole

## Docker Password Update

Containor: [pihole/pihole](https://hub.docker.com/r/pihole/pihole) 

When I tried to set the environment variable `WEBPASSWORD_FILE` in the docker compose, the password was still randomly generated password.
Steps for manualy updating it after initial deployment.

1. Spin a shell within the container
    - Run `docker ps` for the container id
2. Change the pihole password within the container
    - This can't be changed through the webui

```{.sh}
$ docker exec -it <container id> sh
> $ sudo pihole -a -p
> $ exit
```
